        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A nice play on chicken Alfredo, easy to make and yummy to eat. My entire family enjoys it, even my 1-year-old!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
            <li>½ (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce</li>
            <li>1½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Place chicken into a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat and simmer until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, about 15 minutes. </li>
            <li>At the same time, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Drain cooked chicken and cut into bite-size pieces.</li>
            <li>Place chicken, noodles, Alfredo sauce, 1/2 mozzarella cheese, milk, onion powder, and garlic powder in a large bowl and mix well. </li>
            <li>Pour into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Layer remaining mozzarella cheese and Cheddar cheese on top. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until melted and bubbly, about 25 minutes. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
        <p>You can use any medium pasta noodles that you prefer, such as ziti, large elbow, etc.</p>
        <p>If using the second half of a jar of Alfredo sauce, swirl the milk in the jar to get all of it out.</p>
