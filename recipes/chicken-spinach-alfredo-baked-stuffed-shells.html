         <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Chicken pasta bakes are the pinnacle of comfort food. These warm and cozy one-pan dinners have layers of flavor and texture—tender pasta is perfectly complemented by creamy sauce, protein-packed meat, and (more often than not) a crispy cheese topping. From crowd-pleasing 9x13 casseroles to fun twists on classics, you'll find a new favorite here. </p>
